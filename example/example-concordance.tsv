# Columns are tab-separated. Multiple tabs can be used for readability, and will automatically be collapsed.
# Column 1 can be a regular expression, and is implicitly case-INsensitive if all in lowercase.
# If Column 1 is mixed-case, it is treated as case-sensitive. You can also prefix it with = to ensure case-sensitivity.
# Whatever column 1 captures in the document will become a bracketed index mark, e.g. [col1]{^}
# Column 2 is optional. If present, its contents are inserted literally into the mark {^HERE}
# The usual rules apply about requiring quotation marks around heading-path segments containing whitespace.
# Any columns after 2 are ignored, as are blank lines, lines with only whitespace, or lines beginning with #
# The usual index marks syntax is supported in column 2, but aliases and locator suffixes/emphasis don't make much sense for bulk-marking.
